I have divided whole task into 2 scripts:

part 1 : FetchData.py

it reads input file , fetches data from given url, saves text file in OutputFiles folder.

Note: make sure to create a folder in same directory where script is being executed by name 'OutputFiles'

part 2 : Analysis.py

it reads input file , reads text file name from it , searches for that given text file in 'OutputFiles' folder
and performs textual analysis on each given text files , writes all data 'OutputDataStructure.csv' file
as asked in problem statement.


I have leveraged multi threading using ThreadPoolExecutor to make my script work faster.
